# Car Sharing Project (Learning)
This is a frontend-focused car-sharing project, created to practice responsive design and UI development using Vue.js and SCSS. 
The backend API is no longer operational, but the user interface remains functional, allowing visitors to explore the layout and interactions.

Features
- Responsive Layout: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile.
- Interactive UI: Book a car, view locations (non-functional backend).
